Daphne, the daughter of two peasants, Beric and Floria, is a farmer:  
in other words, a slave. 
Although they were always hungry and cold, 
her family continued their life silently, thinking of each other..
She was a middle child until her big brother died of pneumonia during last winter. 
With a sense of responsibility of having to raise her baby sister, she farms and farms.

--------------
However, after endless days of repeated farming, she realizes...

"If I only farm, I will never be able to escape this hellish, hungry life.
I will learn martial arts and become a knight!"

She goes to a martial arts school, but at first, he is rejected at the doorstep.
The principal asks to pay the money. 
She has to raise corn and sells it to raise money for tuition.
